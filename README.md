# Hometasking

This is a Next.JS app designed to assist the Taskmaster('s assistant), Alex Horne with his #hometasking initiative. This is being built on the fly, so it's rough edges all around, such is the life of the self-appointed Taskmaster('s assistant('s assistant))

Good luck to all.

### Information for non-UK coders

In the UK, a television show called Taskmaster has swept the nation, involving people accomplishing ridiculous tasks in even more ridiculous ways.  To combat cabin fever and make sure we all do our part and make safe choices, Alex Horne, creator of Taskmaster, is sending out Hometasking tasks so that the nation can play along together (seperately).  The goal of this project is to compile the list of tasks, points awarded, and the best videos from this time.
